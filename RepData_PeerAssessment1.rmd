Reproducible Research: Peer Assessment 1
========================

###1. Code for reading in the dataset and/or processing the data

```{r}
data <- read.csv("activity.csv", header = TRUE, colClasses = c("double","character","double"), na.strings = "NA")

head(data)
summary(data)
```

###2. Histogram of the total number of steps taken each day  

```{r}
histData <- aggregate(data$steps, list(date = data$date), FUN=sum, na.rm=TRUE)

with(histData, hist(x, col = "green", breaks=20,xlab = "Number of Steps Taken Per Day"))

```

Summary Statistics including mean and meadian for number of steps taken per day

```{r}
summary(histData$x)
```

###3. What is the average daily activity pattern?

Make a time series plot (i.e. type = "l") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all days (y-axis)

```{r}
timeData <-  aggregate(data$steps, list(interval=data$interval), FUN=mean, na.rm=TRUE)
head(timeData)
with(timeData, plot(interval, x, main = "Average number of steps taken per 5 minute interval", ylab = "Number of steps taken", xlab = "5 minute interval"))
lines(timeData$interval, timeData$x, type = "l")
```

Which 5-minute interval, on average across all the days in the dataset, contains the maximum number of steps?

```{r}
timeData[timeData$x == max(timeData$x, na.rm = TRUE),]
```

###4. Imputing missing values

Calculate and report the total number of missing values in the dataset (i.e. the total number of rows with NAs)

```{r}
naCount <-  rowSums(is.na(data))
table(naCount)
```
There are 2304 NA rows in this dataset

Devise a strategy for filling in all of the missing values in the dataset. The strategy does not need to be sophisticated. For example, you could use the mean/median for that day, or the mean for that 5-minute interval, etc.

```{r}
filler <-  function(steps, interval) {

        if (!is.na(steps))
                fillValue <- steps
        else
                fillValue <- mean(timeData[timeData$interval==interval,"x"], na.rm = TRUE)
        return(fillValue)
}

filledData <- data
filledData$steps <- mapply(filler, filledData$steps, filledData$interval)
head(filledData)


```


Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day. 

```{r}
histFilledData <- aggregate(filledData$steps, list(date = filledData$date), FUN=sum, na.rm=TRUE)

with(histFilledData, hist(x, col = "green", breaks=20,xlab = "Number of Steps Taken Per Day", main = "Total Number of Steps Taken Per Day"))

```


Calculate and report the mean and median total number of steps taken per day. Do these values differ from the estimates from the first part of the assignment? What is the impact of imputing missing data on the estimates of the total daily number of steps?

```{r}
summary(histFilledData$x)
```

The median number of steps taken per day increased 10400 -> 10770 and the mean increased 9354  -> 10770. Now the mean = median

###5. Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?

For this part the weekdays() function may be of some help here. Use the dataset with the filled-in missing values for this part.

Create a new factor variable in the dataset with two levels - "weekday" and "weekend" indicating whether a given date is a weekday or weekend day.

```{r}
filledData$dateType <-  ifelse(as.POSIXlt(filledData$date)$wday %in% c(0,6), 'weekend', 'weekday')
head(filledData)
```

Make a panel plot containing a time series plot (i.e. type = "l") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all weekday days or weekend days (y-axis). See the README file in the GitHub repository to see an example of what this plot should look like using simulated data.





```{r}
histFilledData2 <- aggregate(filledData$steps, list(interval = filledData$interval, dateType = filledData$dateType), FUN=mean, na.rm=TRUE)

library(lattice)

xyplot(x ~interval | dateType, data = histFilledData2, layout = c(1,2), ylab = "Number of Steps", xlab = "Interval", type = "b")

```
